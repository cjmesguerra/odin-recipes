    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We like this pasta with chicken and mushroom Alfredo sauce as-is but you can tweak it any way you like by adding or taking away anything. I sometimes add peas. Serve with garlic or any good crusty bread. Good stuff! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>    
        <li>½ cup salted butter</li>    
        <li>2 cups sliced mushrooms</li>    
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>    
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>    
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>    
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>  
        <li>salt and ground white pepper to taste</li>  
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray, place chicken breasts in the pan, and cover with a lid or foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and shred with 2 forks.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is roasting, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion; saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and add cream cheese; stir until melted. Whisk in heavy cream and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all combined and creamy, about 3 minutes. Don't simmer for to long or over high heat; the sauce can break down and become curdled instead of creamy.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta and add to sauce with shredded chicken.</li>
    </ol>
